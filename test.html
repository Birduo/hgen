<h1>L-Systems</h1>
<br>
L-systems, or Lindenmayer systems, are a way of simulating bacteria, plant, and fractal growth. <br>
This is done using recursive string rewriting and a way to render strings to a 2D or 3D space, which can be used to create multiple general rulesets.<br>
<br>
Recursive string rewriting is used in L-systems to generate the "growth" of the preferred organism. <br>
This is done using a set of rules that are applied to modify a given string recursively. <br>
Consider the following L-system: <br>
<pre><code>
A -> AB
B -> A
</code></pre>
<br>
Given a "seed" string of "A" at generation <code>n = 0</code>, the above rules would generate a string of "AB" at generation <code>n = 1</code>.<br>
Following this context, here are some further generations.<br>
<pre><code>
0: A
1: AB
2: ABA
3: ABAAB
4: ABAAABA
</code></pre>
<br>
Note how this is done on the whole string, and not just the end portion of the string.<br>
