<h1>qs8 - Python Statevector Simulator</h1>
<br>qs8 is a quantum statevector simulator built in Python for small-scale projects. It was mostly an exercise in my own abilities in how the domains of linear algebra and quantum computing overlap, and only uses the <code>numpy</code> module as its core dependency.<br><br>In the future, I might adapt this project to JS for browser-based quantum simulation projects.<br><br><h2>How does it work?</h2>
Quantum circuits are organized as a list of gates, where each entry is a timestep column. Index 0 is <code>t0</code>, index 1 is <code>t1</code>, etc. You can interpret the circuit by using matrix multiplication to evolve the statevector column by column, or build the entire circuit into a single unitary to then execute in one step. The single-stepping feature of this makes it easier to debug and figure out problems with state. <br><br>Pre-made gates include <code>H</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, <code>Z</code>, <code>CX</code>, <code>CXl</code>, and <code>SWP</code>. <code>CX</code> and<code>CXl</code> are the standard and <code>l</code>ower version of the <code>CNOT</code> gate. Custom gates can be created as numpy arrays as seen in the current implementation of <code>qs8.py</code>:<br><pre><code class="language-python"># this has the first qb listed as control
CX = np.asarray([[1, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 1],
                 [0, 0, 1, 0],
                 [0, 1, 0, 0]])
</code></pre>
<br>The core stipulation of this project is that there is currently <b>no</b> sugar on the multi-qubit operations. This means that qubits must be directly next to each other for a multi-qubit operation to take place.<br><br>For an example, let's create a circuit that initializes a GHZ state between 4 qubits.<br><pre><code class="language-python">from qs8 import *
qb = 4
# creating a circuit w/ 4 qubits
qc = QCirc(qb)
</code></pre>
<br>After creating the quantum circuit with the associated amount of wires, or qubits, let's set the first couple of gates to test with.<br><pre><code class="language-python"># setting the gate on q0 in column 0 to X
qc.set_gate(X, [0], 0)
# setting the gate on q0 in column 1 to H
qc.set_gate(H, [0], 1)
</code></pre>
<br>The X gate runs a NOT on qubit 0, or <code>q0</code>, in column 0, and the H runs a Hadamard on <code>q0</code> in column 1. Notice that the affected qubits are input as a list.<br><pre><code class="language-python"># create CX gates linking from q0 to qb-1 (q3)
for i in range(qb - 1):
    qc.set_gate(CX, [i, i + 1], i + 2)
</code></pre>
<br>Now we use a for loop to add CX gates between <code>q(i)</code> and <code>q(i+1)</code><br><pre><code class="language-python"># builds and runs circuit
qc.run_circuit(build=True)

# getting a dictionary of counts
counts = qc.get_counts(10000)

# print the circuit and counts
print(str(qc))
print(counts)
</code></pre>
<br>After the circuit is created, you can build the unitary while running by setting <code>build=True</code>. Additionally, you can interpret the circuit column by column by running <code>qc.interpret_circuit()</code> instead. You can get a dictionary of n shots by using the <code>get_counts</code> function on this circuit. Finally, the circuit has a <code>__str__</code> method that prints the circuit in a readable format.<br>The output after running this script can be seen below:<br><br><pre><code class="nohighlight">q0 X-H-CX----
       |
q1 ----o-CX--
         |
q2 ------o-CX
           |
q3 --------o-

{'15': 4986, '0': 5014}
