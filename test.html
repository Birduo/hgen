<h1>L-Systems</h1>
<br>
L-systems, or Lindenmayer systems, are a way of simulating bacteria, plant, and fractal growth. This is done using recursive string rewriting and a way to render strings to a 2D or 3D space, which can be used to create multiple general rulesets.<br>
Recursive string rewriting is used in L-systems to generate the "growth" of the preferred organism. This is done using a set of rules that are applied to modify a given string recursively. Consider the following L-system: <pre><code>
A -> AB
B -> A
</code></pre>
Given a "seed" string of "A" at generation `n = 0`, the above rules would generate a string of "AB" at generation `n = 1`.Following this context, here are some further generations.<pre><code>
0: A
1: AB
2: ABA
3: ABAAB
4: ABAAABA
</code></pre>
Note how this is done on the whole string, and not just the end portion of the string.<br>
